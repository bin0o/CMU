# How to Run

Our application works with Firebase so there's no need to connect to anything else, just run the code and it's done.

# Funcionalities:
- Creating an Account with **Sign Up**, Logging In with **Sign In** and entering as a Guest with **Continue as a Guest** Button.
- Viewing the Pharmacies in the Map (there are already a few on the database). Including your favorites that will appear in a golden marker (adding a farmacy to your favorites is not yet implemented).
- Searching for Street names.
- Searching for Pharmacy Names (that exist in the database).
- Searching for Medicine Name (this retrieves the closest pharmacy that has the medicine); Sub-String search is functional. (There are only a few Medicines in the Database).
- Adding a Pharmacy.

## Additional Files:
We have a JSON file that represents how the database looks [here](PharmacIST_DB.json).

Adittionaly we have a User that you can test with:
